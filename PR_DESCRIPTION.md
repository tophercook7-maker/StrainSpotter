   - First: `backend/migrations/2025_add_vendors_dispensaries.sql`
   - Then: `backend/migrations/2025_seed_vendors_dispensaries_data.sql`
3. Verify `strains` table has data (sample data links to `blue-dream`, `og-kush`, `girl-scout-cookies`)

### **Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Login with test account
- [ ] Navigate to Garden dashboard
- [ ] Click "Strain Browser" tile
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test type filter (Indica/Sativa/Hybrid)
- [ ] Click a strain card to open details
- [ ] Verify all 4 tabs display correctly
- [ ] Check vendor/dispensary data shows pricing
- [ ] Verify back navigation works

### **Key Files to Review:**
- `frontend/src/components/StrainBrowser.jsx` - Main component (300 lines)
- `frontend/src/components/Garden.jsx` - Integration point
- `backend/migrations/2025_add_vendors_dispensaries.sql` - Schema
