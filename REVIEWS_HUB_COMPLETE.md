## 📊 Database Schema

The Reviews Hub uses the existing `reviews` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  strain_slug text REFERENCES strains(slug),
  rating integer CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  comment text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

Joins with `strains` table to get:
- `name` - Strain name
- `slug` - Strain identifier
- `type` - Indica/Sativa/Hybrid
