# Console Errors - Fixed ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Duplicate React Keys Error

**Error:**
```
Encountered two children with the same key, `membership-join`. 
Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```

**Cause:**
Three Pro-gated tiles in `Home.jsx` all used the same key `membership-join` when user was not Pro.

**Fix:**
Changed keys to be unique:
- `'strains'` ‚Üí `'membership-join-strains'` (when not Pro)
- `'groups'` ‚Üí `'membership-join-groups'` (when not Pro)
- `'growers'` ‚Üí `'membership-join-growers'` (when not Pro)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in latest build

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è IGNORE: Browser Extension Warnings

**Warning:**
```
Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
```

**What it means:**
This is a harmless warning from **Chrome browser extensions** (like password managers, ad blockers, React DevTools, etc.) trying to communicate with the page. It has nothing to do with your app.

**Why it happens:**
- Extension sends a message to your page
- Page doesn't have a listener for that message
- Extension's message port times out

**Action needed:** None! This is normal and doesn't affect functionality.

**To verify it's just extensions:**
1. Open Chrome in Incognito mode (extensions disabled by default)
2. Visit http://localhost:4173
3. Check console - warnings should be gone

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è NORMAL: React DevTools Message

**Message:**
```
Download the React DevTools for a better development experience: 
https://react.dev/link/react-devtools
```

**What it means:**
React suggests installing the React DevTools browser extension for easier debugging.

**Action needed (optional):**
- Install [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/link/react-devtools) for Chrome
- Adds a "‚öõÔ∏è Components" tab to DevTools to inspect React component tree
