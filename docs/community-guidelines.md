# StrainSpotter Community Guidelines

Welcome to StrainSpotter Groups and Chat. These rules keep conversations helpful, safe, and legal. By participating, you agree to follow these guidelines.

## Be respectful

- Treat others with kindness. No harassment, bullying, slurs, or hate speech.
- Disagree with ideas, not people. No name-calling or personal attacks.

## Keep it legal and safe

- No buying, selling, trading, or soliciting cannabis, products, or services.
- No arranging meetups, deliveries, or shipping. Don’t share contact details to transact.
- No instructions that could harm people or property. Avoid dangerous dosing advice.
- Follow your local laws and age restrictions.

## No spam or scams

- No promotions, giveaways, referral links, or affiliate codes unless approved by admins.
- No link shorteners or off-platform invites used to solicit (e.g., Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord).
- Don’t post repetitive content or engage in deceptive behavior.

## Privacy first

- Don’t post anyone’s personal information (yours or others): phone numbers, emails, addresses, IDs.
- Don’t pressure others to share private info or move conversations off-platform.

## Quality over quantity

- Share experiences, learnings, and questions. Be specific and honest.
- No medical claims or diagnoses. Always consult a medical professional.
- Credit sources. Don’t share copyrighted materials you don’t own the rights to.

## What’s allowed

- Sharing personal experiences with strains, effects, and tips.
- Discussing legal dispensaries, pricing, and availability in general terms.
- Educational content, growing best practices, and community support.

## What’s not allowed (examples)

- “DM me for plugs/prices” or “text me at (555) 555-5555.”
- Posts containing emails, phone numbers, payment handles (Cash App/Venmo/Zelle/PayPal), or crypto to transact.
- “Buy weed online,” “discreet shipping worldwide,” “no ID required.”
- Hate speech, slurs, harassment, threats, sexual content targeting individuals.
- Spammy promos, link shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl), or off-platform sales groups.

## Moderation and enforcement
We use automated filtering plus community reporting. Depending on severity and history, we may:

- Remove content
- Issue a warning
- Temporarily restrict posting (“timeout”)
- Permanently ban accounts for repeated or severe violations

You can report content via the flag button on messages. Reports are reviewed by moderators.

## Health and legal disclaimers

- Cannabis laws vary by location; always comply with your local regulations and age requirements.

## Appeals
If you believe a moderation action was a mistake, reply to the moderation notice or contact support with context. We’ll review.

## Updates
These guidelines may evolve. We’ll announce significant changes. Thank you for keeping StrainSpotter helpful, respectful, and safe.
