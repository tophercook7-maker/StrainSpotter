## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed (Test These)

### 1. **Help Page Navigation** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. Go to home page
2. Click "Help & How-To" tile
3. Try clicking different feature tiles (Scanner, History, Strains, etc.)
4. Each should navigate to that feature

**Expected:** Tiles should navigate properly (they were stuck before due to old colors)

---

### 2. **Auth/Login Home Button** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. From home, click "Login" tile
2. Look for white "Home" button at top
3. Click it

**Expected:** Should navigate back to home (wasn't there before)

---

### 3. **Green Text Theme** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. Browse any page
2. Check text colors‚Äîshould be green shades instead of white/gray

**Expected:** 
- Main text: Soft sage green (#9CCC65)
- Secondary text: Muted olive green (#7CB342)
- Everywhere: headers, body text, labels

---

### 4. **Grow Coach - Massively Expanded** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. Click "Grow Coach" tile
2. Go through each tab (11 total):
   - Overview
   - Setup
   - Germination
   - Vegetative
   - Flowering
   - Harvest
   - Dry & Cure
   - Watering
   - Nutrients & Deficiencies
   - Pests & IPM
   - Schedules & Checklists

**Expected:**

- Pro tips, troubleshooting, timelines
- Harvest Assistant with sliders still works

**Key sections to check:**
- **Flowering tab:** Week-by-week timeline (weeks 1-10+)
- **Harvest tab:** 4 harvest methods compared
- **Dry & Cure tab:** Burping schedule, troubleshooting mold

---

### 5. **Scanner - No More Hanging** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. Click "Scanner" tile
2. Take/upload a photo
3. Click "Scan & Identify Strain"
4. **Watch the button text** as it processes

**Expected:**
- Button shows progress messages:
  - "Preparing images..."
  - "Uploading image 1 of 1..."
  - "Analyzing image 1 with AI (this may take 30-60 seconds)..."
  - "Matching results to strain database..."
- If it takes too long (60+ seconds), you'll get: "AI analysis timed out after 60 seconds. Please try again..."
- No more indefinite hanging!

**Note:** You need Google Vision API configured in backend for this to work. Check `env/.env.local` for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE_VISION_JSON`.

---

### 6. **Seeds Now Show** ‚úì
**Test:**
1. Click "Seeds & Genetics" tile
2. Should see 2 sample seed items (Blue Dream, OG Kush)

- SQL scripts to create all tables with RLS policies
- Backend API routes (Express) for group management and messaging
- Supabase Realtime integration for live messaging
- Frontend component structure (GroupsList, GroupChatWindow, MessageInput, etc.)

---

### **Seed Catalog** 
**File:** `SEED_CATALOG_SETUP.md`

2. Add to strain_library.json (integrated, 4-6 hours)
3. Scrape seed banks (automated, 8-12 hours)
4. Third-party API integration (ongoing cost)

**To implement:** Choose an option and follow the guide

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Not Running
```bash
# Check if backend is up
curl http://localhost:5181/health

# If not, start it
cd /Users/christophercook/Projects/strainspotter/backend
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Not Showing Changes
```bash
# Rebuild frontend
cd /Users/christophercook/Projects/strainspotter/frontend
npm run build

# Restart preview (kill old ones first)
pkill -f "vite.*preview"
npx vite preview --port 5173 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Green Text Not Showing
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Clear browser cache
- Check theme file was updated: `frontend/src/theme/cannabisTheme.js`

### Scanner Still Hanging
**Check:**
1. Backend running? `http://localhost:5181/health` should return `{ ok: true }`
2. Google Vision configured?
   - Open `env/.env.local`
   - Should have either:
     - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=../env/google-vision-key.json`
     - OR `GOOGLE_VISION_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}`
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Test backend scan directly:**
```bash
# Upload test image
curl -X POST http://localhost:5181/api/uploads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","base64":"..."}'

# Process it (replace ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5181/api/scans/YOUR_SCAN_ID/process
```

### Help Tiles Not Navigating
- Check browser console for React errors
- Verify you're clicking tiles, not the background
- Try clicking "Home" button first, then Help again
